# Auckland_Housing

As I will be relocating to Auckland shortly, I aimed to conceive an interactive tool to let the user visualize available rental listings in Auckland. I scraped myrent.co.nz in order to obtain data on the first 500 listings available, which were then geo-located on Google maps.

Thanks for Plamen Pasliev for the inspiration!
